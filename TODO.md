# To Do

Blockers:
- [ ] Fix documentation design issues
- [ ] The titles are all the same

Waiting:
- [ ] Retrieve statistics
- [ ] Handle package universes
- [ ] Add rev-deps in the package overview

Nice to have:
- [ ] Add Opam publish documentation

Feedback:
- [ ] Should add the meta descriptions for search engine
- [ ] The heading section for the packages looks.. lifeless
- [ ] Add a search in the docs feature
- [ ] Add an overlow scroll to the TOC in the documentation
- [ ] Mobile view of the documentation looks off
